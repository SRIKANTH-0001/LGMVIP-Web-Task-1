                                    To-Do List Project Overview
Usage:


1.App.js: Manages the state for the entire to-do list and passes state and functions to child components.
2.Todo.js: Displays individual to-do items and handles actions like marking a to-do as complete or deleting it.
3.TodoForm.js: Contains a form to add new to-dos, manages input state, and submits new todos to App.js.
4.TodoList.js: Renders a list of Todo components, displaying each to-do and handling actions through functions passed from App.js.
5.App.css: Styles the to-do list application, including todos, the form, and overall layout. Allows customization like adjusting font size.

Key Features:

||-Displaying Todos: TodoList.js maps over todos and creates a Todo component for each.
||-Completing Todos: Mark todos as complete through state updates managed in App.js.
||-Deleting Todos: Remove todos using a delete function passed from App.js.
||-Styling: Customize the appearance with App.css, including font size and layout adjustments
